## Markdown Tips

If you are unfamiliar with MarkDown, check out 
[the official documentation](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Note that IntelliJ IDEA has a Markdown preview that you can access in 
the upper-right of the editor. Also, since Markdown documents&mdash;like
source code&mdash;should be human-readable, make sure you keep your lines
short, as you can see I have done in my Markdown files.

Please remove this subsection before submitting your report. 

## Challenge #1 Complete

(Explain your solution to Challenge #1. If it is not complete, change
the subsection title above to "Incomplete" and explain how far you got
and where you got stuck.)

## Challenge #2 Complete

(Explain your solution to Challenge #2. If it is not complete, change
the subsection title above to "Incomplete" and explain how far you got
and where you got stuck.)

## Challenge #3 Complete

(Explain your solution to Challenge #3. If it is not complete, change
the subsection title above to "Incomplete" and explain how far you got
and where you got stuck.)

## Reflection Question #1: Functional vs OO

(Write one or more paragraphs comparing and contrasting the iterative and functional  
approaches to string concatenation you explored in challenge #3. Which do you
prefer, and why?)

## Reflection Question #2: Polymorphism and Dependency Inversion

(Explain how polymorphism engendered dependency inversion in this little
application. Be clear and precise here, as this is, in part, an assessment of
your correct use of technical terminology.
Consider, for example, where exactly is polymorphism used?
Where exactly is a dependency inverted?)
